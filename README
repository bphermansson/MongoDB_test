This projects is a place for learning and showing how to work with MongoDB in a C application.

To use the code:

  Atlas section. Instructions for this are at https://www.mongodb.com/basics/mongodb-atlas-tutorial. 
- Rename 'settings copy' to 'settings' and adjust the settings to match your MongoDB account.

  MongoDB cloud and select "Security/Quickstart". Scroll down and add your IP to the IP Access List.

#define COL_DB_NAME "myFirstDatabase" - Name of the database to work with.
Doesn't have to exist before you write to it.
#define COL_NAME "Cluster0" - The cluster in the database to write to.
